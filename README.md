# XMRsouk

**XMRsouk** is a Lebanon-based initiative to promote and expand the adoption of Monero (XMR) in real-world businesses, e-commerce, and delivery services.

The name “XMRsouk” combines the international ticker for Monero (XMR) with the Arabic word "Souk" (سوق), meaning "marketplace" — representing our mission to build a Monero-powered economy across Lebanon.
