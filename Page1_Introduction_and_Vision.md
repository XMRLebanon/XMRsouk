üìò XMRsouk Project

The Monero Marketplace in Lebanon


---

üß© Introduction

Since 2019, Lebanon has been enduring a severe economic and financial collapse that led to:

A devaluation of the Lebanese Lira by over 98%.

Banks freezing deposits and the public losing trust in the financial system.

A surge in the use of physical cash due to the banking sector paralysis.

Skyrocketing unemployment and a drastic decline in purchasing power.


In this environment, there's a growing need for a private, decentralized, and censorship-resistant financial solution. Monero (XMR) offers exactly that:

Full financial privacy and independence.

True decentralization.

Resistance to confiscation and surveillance.

Practical for real-world peer-to-peer use.


This is the motivation behind launching XMRsouk ‚Äî a Monero-first ecosystem built for Lebanon.


---

üß≠ What is XMRsouk?

XMRsouk = XMR + "Souk" (Arabic for "marketplace")

It is a digital platform where Monero becomes the core medium of exchange for daily commercial use in Lebanon ‚Äî from retail shops to service providers, deliveries, peer-to-peer commerce, and Monero-themed merchandise.
