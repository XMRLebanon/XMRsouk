🧭 XMRsouk Field Promotion Plan in Lebanon
Two-Week Intensive Campaign


---

🎯 Introduction

Amid the deep economic and financial crisis in Lebanon, it has become essential to find decentralized and reliable monetary alternatives that allow people and merchants to freely exchange value outside the collapsing banking system.
The XMRsouk project aims to introduce Monero (XMR) as a practical and secure option for daily transactions.

To achieve genuine adoption, the project will launch a focused field campaign targeting merchants across various Lebanese regions through direct visits aimed at educating, convincing, and assisting them in accepting Monero.
